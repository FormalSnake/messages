//! The Linux UI face. Distributions ship Noto Sans as one variable file, and
//! gpui-pre's Linux renderer draws a variable font at its default instance
//! whatever weight is asked for, so every semibold heading came out regular.

//! its closest-weight match three real faces to choose from.
//!
//! `packaging/fonts/MessagesSans-*.ttf` are the static Noto Sans faces from
//! notofonts.github.io (OFL, `packaging/fonts/OFL.txt`), cut with
//! `pyftsubset --unicodes=U+0000-036F,U+0370-03FF,U+0400-052F,U+1C80-1C8F,U+1E00-1FFF,U+2000-20CF,U+2100-23FF,U+25A0-25FF,U+2C60-2C7F,U+2DE0-2DFF,U+A640-A69F,U+A720-A7FF,U+FB00-FB06,U+FEFF,U+FFFD --layout-features='*' --no-hinting`
//! and renamed to `FAMILY` (name IDs 1-4, 6, 16, 17). Anything outside that
//! range, CJK included, falls back through the system fonts as before.
